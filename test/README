*** ABOUT TESTS FOR TCP-IO-BRIDGE ***

Included tests are written in Python 3.3 originally on windows, so a 
simple batch file is included to run the tests automatically.

Requirements:

- Python 3.3
- Python libraries: numpy, pillow

Usage:

Run your node.js app first, then connect via web browser, then run
your test script. The TCP socket will be bound to an available web 
socket and create a 1 to 1 line of communication.
